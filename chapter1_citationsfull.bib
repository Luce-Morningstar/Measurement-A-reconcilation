	abstract = {Subsolar mass black holes could show up in gravitational wave observations in future and near-solar mass black holes might have been involved in the events GW190425 and GW190814. Since they cannot form from the stellar evolution, their creation requires exotic mechanisms. One such mechanism involves the capture of dark matter particles by stellar objects and their thermalization. When the criterion for the collapse of these dark matter particles is satisfied, a tiny endoparasitic black hole (EBH) forms and then it accretes matter from the host. The EBH may transmute the host into a black hole of nearly the same mass as the host or lesser, depending on the type of accretion. We examine this complex and poorly-explored accretion mechanism, considering the effects of rotation and viscosity but ignoring some other effects, such as those of pressure and magnetic field, as the first step. Using a general framework to assess the effects of rotation and viscosity on accretion, we show that the accretion could be stalled in some white dwarfs, but not in neutron stars. The stalled accretion should cause an opening in the host's polar regions, the extent of which depends on the mass and spin of the host.},

	abstract = {A prevalent tool in the teaching of planar kinematics is Euler's formula, namely, ejθ=cosθ+jsinθ, with j defined as j2≡−1, regarded as an operator in the complex-number plane. This operator maps every complex number z=x+jy into xcosθ−ysinθ+j(xsinθ+ycosθ). When z is represented as a vector in the complex plane, ejθz is z rotated through an angle θ ccw. This works and helps derive expressions for the position, velocity, and acceleration of a point of a rigid body in a systematic way. The downside of this practice is twofold: (i) it hides the geometrical meaning of the rotation; and (ii) it prevents the generalization of the operator to three dimensions. As an alternative to the use of Euler's formula, the 2×2 rotation matrix is available, but its use is not common in textbooks. The purpose of this paper is to stress the benefits of the use of this matrix in two dimensions, its straightforward generalization to three dimensions, and a possible extension to higher dimensions, if the need arises. An example of the use of the rotation matrix in planar kinematics is included, by means of an example taken from an application in mobile robotics.},

	abstract = {The notion of a physical collapse of the wave function is embodied in dynamical collapse models. These involve a modification of the unitary evolution of the wave function so as to give a dynamical account of collapse. The resulting dynamics is at first sight time asymmetric for the simple reason that the wave function depends on those collapse events in the past but not those in the future. Here we show that dynamical wave-function collapse models admit a general description that has no built-in direction of time. Given some simple constraints, we show that there exist empirically equivalent pictures of collapsing wave functions in both time directions, each satisfying the same dynamical rules. A preferred direction is singled out only by the asymmetric initial and final time constraints on the state of the universe.},

We show mathematically that in GRW theory (and similar theories) there are limitations to knowledge, that is, inhabitants of a GRW universe cannot find out all the facts true about their universe. As a specific example, they cannot accurately measure the number of collapses that a given physical system undergoes during a given time interval; in fact, they cannot reliably measure whether one or zero collapses occur. Put differently, in a GRW universe certain meaningful, factual questions are empirically undecidable. We discuss several types of limitations to knowledge and compare them with those in other (no-collapse) versions of quantum mechanics, such as Bohmian mechanics. Most of our results also apply to observer-induced collapses as in orthodox quantum mechanics (as opposed to the spontaneous collapses of GRW theory).},

Specifically, we find that the initial width of the emerging wave function in inelastic scattering is primarily determined by the size of the participating scattering center and the range of the scattering potential, but not by the width of the incoming wave function. This indicates that dynamical collapse of the wave function through inelastic scattering can explain the emergence of particle-like signals.},

We explore the frustrated physics of these lattices by creating negative absolute temperature states where the sign of the tunneling is effectively inverted.

In the triangular lattice, we observe that in the frustrated case the critical interaction strength for the bosonic superfluid to Mott insulator transition is strongly reduced, and also observe signatures of the chiral nature of the superfluid as well as indications for a chiral Mott insulator. For the kagome lattice, we investigate the many-body physics that comes into play when we melt a kagome Mott insulator into the flat band. European Union (ERC), EPSRC, UKRI.},

	abstract = {In quantum mechanics, empty space is not void but is characterized by vacuum-field fluctuations, which underlie phenomena such as the Lamb shift1, spontaneous emission, and the Casimir effect2. Due to their quantitatively small relative contributions in free-space atomic physics, they were traditionally overlooked in solid-state systems. Recently, however, the interplay between electronic correlations and quantum electrodynamical effects in low-dimensional systems has become a rapidly advancing area in condensed matter physics3-5, with substantial implications for quantum materials and device engineering. High-mobility two-dimensional electron gases in the quantum Hall regime6 offer an ideal platform to investigate how vacuum electromagnetic fields affect strongly correlated electronic states. Here we demonstrate that adjusting the coupling strength between a two-dimensional electron gas and the vacuum fields of a hovering split-ring resonator leads to a significant reduction in exchange splitting at odd-integer filling factors, along with an enhancement of fractional quantum Hall gaps at filling factors 4/3, 5/3 and 7/5. Theoretical analysis indicates that these effects stem from an effective long-range attractive interaction mediated by virtual cavity photons in regions with strong vacuum electric field gradients. Our findings uncover a new mechanism by which cavity vacuum fields can reshape electronic correlations in quantum Hall systems, establishing a new approach for manipulating correlated quantum phases in low-dimensional materials and paving the way for engineering tailored many-body interactions in compact devices.},

	abstract = {The nature of dark matter is poorly constrained on subgalactic scales. Alternative models to cold dark matter, such as warm dark matter or self-interacting dark matter, could produce very different dark haloes on these scales. One of the few known dark haloes smaller than a galaxy was discovered in the triple source plane strong lens system J0946 + 1006. Previous studies have found that this structure is much more concentrated than expected in Lambda cold dark matter (\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM), but have assumed the dark halo is at the same redshift as the main deflector (\$z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm main\}=0.222\$). In this paper, we fit for the redshift of this dark halo. We reconstruct the first two sources in the system using a forward modelling approach, allowing for additional complexity from multipole perturbations. We find that the perturber redshift is \$z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\} = \{0.207\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.019\}\_\{-0.019\}\$, and lower bounds on the evidence strongly prefer a subhalo over a line-of-sight structure. Whilst modelling both background sources does not improve constraints on the redshift of the subhalo, it breaks important degeneracies affecting the reconstruction of multipole perturbations. We find that the subhalo is a more than \$5{\textbackslash}sigma\$ outlier from the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$-\$r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$ relation and has a steep profile with an average slope of \${\textbackslash}gamma \_\{{\textbackslash}rm 2D\} = \{-1.81\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.15\}\_\{-0.11\}\$ for radii between \$0.75 {\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm and\}{\textbackslash}, 1.25\$ kpc. This steep slope might indicate dark matter self-interactions causing the subhalo to undergo gravothermal collapse; such collapsed haloes are expected to have \${\textbackslash}gamma \_\{{\textbackslash}rm 2D\} {\textbackslash}approx -2\$.},

	abstract = {Quantum mechanics, with its revolutionary implications, has posedinnumerable problems to philosophers of science. In particular, it hassuggested reconsidering basic concepts such as the existence of aworld that is, at least to some extent, independent of the observer,the possibility of getting reliable and objective knowledge about it,and the possibility of taking (under appropriate circumstances) atleast some properties to be objectively possessed by physical systems.It has also raised many others questions which are well known to thoseinvolved in the debate on the interpretation of this pillar of modernscience. One can argue that most of the problems are not only due tothe intrinsic revolutionary nature of the phenomena which have led tothe development of the theory. They are also related to the fact that,in its standard formulation and interpretation, quantum mechanics is atheory which is excellent (in fact it has an unprecedented success inthe history of science) in telling us everything about what weobserve, but it meets with serious difficulties in telling uswhat there is. We are making here specific reference to thecentral problem of the theory, usually referred to as themeasurement problem, which is accompanying quantum theory sinceits birth. It is just one of the many attempts to overcome thedifficulties posed by this problem that has led to the development ofCollapse Theories, i.e., to the Dynamical ReductionProgram (DRP). As we shall see, this approach consists inaccepting that the dynamical equation of the standard theory should bemodified by the addition of stochastic and nonlinear terms. The nicefact is that the resulting theory is capable, on the basis of a singledynamics which is assumed to govern all natural processes, to accountat the same time for all well-established facts about microscopicsystems as described by the standard theory, as well as for theso-called postulate of wave packet reduction (WPR), which accompaniesthe interaction of a microscopic system with a measuring device. As iswell known, such a postulate is assumed in the standard scheme just inorder to guarantee that measurements have outcomes but, as weshall discuss below, it meets with insurmountable difficulties if onetries to derive it by assuming the measurement itself to be a processgoverned by the linear laws of the theory. Finally, the collapsetheories account in a completely satisfactory way for the classicalbehavior of macroscopic systems.},

	abstract = {Naive attempts to put together relativity and quantum measurements lead to signaling between space-like separated regions. In QFT, these are known as impossible measurements. We show that the same problem arises in non-relativistic quantum physics, where joint nonlocal measurements (i.e., between systems kept spatially separated) in general lead to signaling, while one would expect no-signaling (based for instance on the principle of no-nonphysical communication). This raises the question: Which nonlocal quantum measurements are physically possible? We review and develop further a non-relativistic quantum information approach developed independently of the impossible measurements in QFT, and show that these two have been addressing virtually the same problem. The non-relativistic solution shows that all nonlocal measurements are localizable (i.e., they can be carried out at a distance without violating no-signaling) but they (i) may require arbitrarily large entangled resources and (ii) cannot in general be ideal, i.e., are not immediately reproducible. These considerations could help guide the development of a complete theory of measurement in QFT.},

	abstract = {Context. HD140283, or the Methuselah star, is a well-known reference object in stellar evolution. Its peculiar chemical composition, proximity and absence of reddening makes it an interesting case-study of Pop II stars. Thanks to recent observational efforts, we now have precise interferometric and spectroscopic constraints, as well as revised astrometric parallaxes from the Gaia mission. Aims. We aim at determining the age of HD140283 with these lastest constraints, as well as quantifying the impact of systematics from physical inaccuracies in the stellar evolution models. Methods. Using recent spectroscopic abundances from the literature, including 3D non-LTE values for C, O, and Fe, we compute opacity tables specific to HD140283. We then use them in grids of stellar evolution models coupled to a Markov Chain Monte Carlo tool to determine the age of HD140283. Results. With our tailored models we find an age of 12.3Gy. Using a solar-scaled mixture instead results in an age value of 14Gy, in tension with the age of the universe (\$13.77{\textbackslash}pm0.06\$Gy). We also find that reducing the mixing length parameter from its solar calibrated value will lead to an even lower age, in agreement with other recent studies. However, we find no direct evidence to favour a lower mixing length parameter value from our modelling. Conclusions. Taking into account the specific elemental abundances is crucial for the modelling of HD140283, as it leads to significant differences in the inferred age. However, this effect is degenerate with a lowering of the mixing length parameter. In this respect, asteroseismic constraints might play a key role in accurately deriving the mass of HD140283, therefore strongly constraining its age.},

The relationship of the classiﬁcation of particles to quantum-ﬁeld-theoretic calculations and the diagrammatic aids that are often used in them is clariﬁed. It is pointed out that the distinction between virtual particles and others and, therefore, judgments regarding their reality have been made on basis of these methods rather than on their physical characteristics. As such, it has obscured the question of their existence. It is here argued that the most inﬂuential arguments against the existence of virtual particles but not other particles fail because they either are arguments against the existence of particles in general rather than virtual particles per se, or are dependent on the imposition of classical intuitions on quantum systems, or are simply beside the point. Several reasons are then provided for considering virtual particles real, such as their descriptive, explanatory, and predictive value, and a clearer characterization of virtuality-one in terms of intermediate states-that also applies beyond perturbation theory is provided. It is also pointed out that in the role of force mediators, they serve to preclude action-at-a-distance between interacting particles. For these reasons, it is concluded that virtual particles are as real as other quantum particles.},

Our analysis reveals a closed-form duality ellipse (DE) equality, that rigorously unifies visibility (a traditional waveness measure) and predictability (a particleness measure) with degree of coherence, providing a complete mathematical embodiment of Bohr's complementarity principle. Extending this framework to quantum imaging with undetected photons (QIUP), where both path information and photon interference are inherently linked to spatial object reconstruction, we establish an imaging duality ellipse (IDE) that directly connects wave-particle duality to the object's transmittance profile. This relation enables object characterization through duality measurements alone and remains robust against experimental imperfections such as decoherence and misalignment. Our results advance the fundamental understanding of quantum duality while offering a practical toolkit for optimizing coherence-driven quantum technologies, from imaging to sensing.},

	abstract = {This study conducts a comparative analysis, using non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF), of two state-of-the-art two-well (TW) Terahertz Quantum Cascade Lasers (THz QCLs) supporting clean 3-level systems. The devices have nearly identical parameters and the NEGF calculations with an abrupt-interface roughness height of 0.12 nm predict a maximum operating temperature (Tmax) of {\textasciitilde} 250 K for both devices. However, experimentally, one device reaches a Tmax of {\textasciitilde} 250 K and the other a Tmax of only {\textasciitilde} 134 K. Both devices were fabricated and measured under identical conditions in the same laboratory, with high quality processes as verified by reference devices. The main difference between the two devices is that they were grown in different MBE reactors. Our NEGF-based analysis considered all parameters related to MBE growth, including the maximum estimated variation in aluminum content, growth rate, doping density, background doping, and abrupt-interface roughness height. From our NEGF calculations it is evident that the sole parameter to which a drastic drop in Tmax could be attributed is the abrupt-interface roughness height. We can also learn from the simulations that both devices exhibit high-quality interfaces, with one having an abrupt-interface roughness height of approximately an atomic layer and the other approximately a monolayer. However, these small differences in interface sharpness are the cause of the large performance discrepancy. This underscores the sensitivity of device performance to interface roughness and emphasizes its strategic role in achieving higher operating temperatures for THz QCLs. We suggest Atom Probe Tomography (APT) as a path to analyze and measure the (graded)-interfaces roughness (IFR) parameters for THz QCLs, and subsequently as a design tool for higher performance THz QCLs, as was done for mid-IR QCLs. Our study not only addresses challenges faced by other groups in reproducing the record Tmax of {\textasciitilde} 250 K and {\textasciitilde} 261 K but also proposes a systematic pathway for further improving the temperature performance of THz QCLs beyond the state-of-the-art.},

Here by utilizing the generalized Born-Huang hydrodynamics model exemplified in SiC, three types of phonons are studied: longitudinal optical phonon, transverse optical phonon and phonon polariton. The Fresnel reflection coefficients for the piezoelectric composed of semi-infinite substrates or thin films are then obtained by taking into account the phonon-electromagnetic coupling. The Casimir interaction, calculated via a generalized Lifshitz approach, is examined to highlight the interplay between different types of phonon modes and electromagnetic excitations. Our study shows that piezoelectrics emerge as materials where this ubiquitous force can be controlled via phonon properties. Different types of surface phonon polaritons associated with structural polytypes may also be distinguished through the Casimir interaction.},

Conversely, it was shown in previous work that modelling such corrections by noncommutative coordinates indeed forces the Kaluza-Klein cylinder ansatz form of the metric, and we now propose that the remaining restrictions needed come from quantum gravity on the fibre. Working with a fuzzy sphere fibre, we find that the expected value of the metric is indeed spherical and we propose that it can be taken as of constant size due to freedom in the renormalisation of divergences. In this way, we outline a mechanism whereby the observed structure of gravity plus Yang-Mills can emerge at low energies as a consequence of quantum gravity effects.},

Using ultracold atoms released from an optical lattice, we realize a Gedanken experiment which interferes single photons scattering off of Heisenberg uncertainty-limited wave packets. We unify the free-space and trapped-atom pictures by measuring the light scattered before and during wave packet expansion and show the coherence properties of the scattered light are independent of the presence of the trap. Therefore, recoilless scattering in a trap (Mössbauer effect), the different frequency of sidebands, and the excitation of an excited harmonic oscillator state are not essential to the question of which fraction of light scattering is coherent or incoherent. Our experiment demonstrates the potential of using atomic Mott insulators to create single-atom wave packets for fundamental studies.},

	abstract = {Time reflection is a uniform inversion of the temporal evolution of a signal, which arises when an abrupt change in the properties of the host material occurs uniformly in space. At such a time interface, a portion of the input signal is time reversed, and its frequency spectrum is homogeneously translated as its momentum is conserved, forming the temporal counterpart of a spatial interface. Combinations of time interfaces, forming time metamaterials and Floquet matter, exploit the interference of multiple time reflections for extreme wave manipulation, leveraging time as an additional degree of freedom. Here we report the observation of photonic time reflection and associated broadband frequency translation in a switched transmission-line metamaterial whose effective capacitance is homogeneously and abruptly changed via a synchronized array of switches. A pair of temporal interfaces are combined to demonstrate time-reflection-induced wave interference, realizing the temporal counterpart of a Fabry-Pérot cavity. Our results establish the foundational building blocks to realize time metamaterials and Floquet photonic crystals, with opportunities for extreme photon manipulation in space and time.},

	abstract = {There has been a growing interest in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics. The key concepts of quantum mechanics are quantum fluctuations. Quantum fluctuations of quantum fields confined in a finite-size system induce the zero-point energy shift. This quantum phenomenon, the Casimir effect, is one of the most striking phenomena of quantum mechanics in the sense that there are no classical analogs and has been attracting much attention beyond the hierarchy of energy scales, ranging from elementary particle physics to condensed matter physics, together with photonics. However, the non-Hermitian extension of the Casimir effect and the application to spintronics have not yet been investigated enough, although exploring energy sources and developing energy-efficient nanodevices are its central issues. Here we fill this gap. By developing a magnonic analog of the Casimir effect into non-Hermitian systems, we show that this non-Hermitian Casimir effect of magnons is enhanced as the Gilbert damping constant (i.e., the energy dissipation rate) increases. When the damping constant exceeds a critical value, the non-Hermitian Casimir effect of magnons exhibits an oscillating behavior, including a beating one, as a function of the film thickness and is characterized by the exceptional point. Our result suggests that energy dissipation serves as a key ingredient of Casimir engineering.},

It is argued that the definition of the time-translation operator for the superposed space-times involves an inherent ill-definedness, leading to an essential uncertainty in the energy of the superposed state which, in the Newtonian limit, is proportional to the gravitational self-energyEΔ of the difference between the two mass distributions. This is consistent with a suggested finite lifetime of the order of ħ/EΔ for the superposed state, in agreement with a certain proposal made by the author for a gravitationally induced spontaneous quantum state reduction, and with closely related earlier suggestions by Diósi and by Ghirardiet al.},

	abstract = {Quantum geometry is a key quantity that distinguishes electrons in a crystal from those in the vacuum. Its study continues to provide insights into quantum materials, uncovering new design principles for their discovery. However, unlike the Berry curvature, an intuitive understanding of the quantum metric is lacking. Here, we show that the quantum metric of Bloch electrons leads to a momentum-space gravity. In particular, by extending the semiclassical formulation of electron dynamics to second order, we find that the resulting velocity is modified by a geodesic term and becomes the momentum-space dual of the Lorentz force in curved space. We calculate this geodesic response for magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene and show that moiré systems with flat bands are ideal candidates to observe this effect. Extending this analogy with gravity further, we find that the momentum-space dual of the Einstein field equations remains sourceless for pure states, while for mixed states it acquires a source term that depends on the von Neumann entropy for small entropies. We compare this stress-energy equation with the weak-field limit of general relativity, and we conclude that the von Neumann entropy is the momentum-space dual of the gravitational potential. Consequently, the momentum-space geodesic equation for mixed states is modified by a term resembling an entropic force. Our results highlight connections between quantum geometry, momentum-space gravity, and quantum information, prompting further exploration of this dual gravity in quantum materials.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous collapse models and Bohmian mechanics are two different solutions to the measurement problem plaguing orthodox quantum mechanics. They have, a priori nothing in common. At a formal level, collapse models add a non-linear noise term to the Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger equation, and extract definite measurement outcomes either from the wave function (e.g. mass density ontology) or the noise itself (flash ontology). Bohmian mechanics keeps the Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger equation intact but uses the wave function to guide particles (or fields), which comprise the primitive ontology. Collapse models modify the predictions of orthodox quantum mechanics, whilst Bohmian mechanics can be argued to reproduce them. However, it turns out that collapse models and their primitive ontology can be exactly recast as Bohmian theories. More precisely, considering (i) a system described by a non-Markovian collapse model, and (ii) an extended system where a carefully tailored bath is added and described by Bohmian mechanics, the stochastic wave-function of the collapse model is exactly the wave-function of the original system conditioned on the Bohmian hidden variables of the bath. Further, the noise driving the collapse model is a linear functional of the Bohmian variables. The randomness that seems progressively revealed in the collapse models lies entirely in the initial conditions in the Bohmian-like theory. Our construction of the appropriate bath is not trivial and exploits an old result from the theory of open quantum systems. This reformulation of collapse models as Bohmian theories brings to the fore the question of whether there exists `unromantic' realist interpretations of quantum theory that cannot ultimately be rewritten this way, with some guiding law. It also points to important foundational differences between `true' (Markovian) collapse models and non-Markovian models.},

	abstract = {Despite rapid developments of wearable self-powered sensors, it is still elusive to decouple the simultaneously applied multiple input signals. Herein, we report the design and demonstration of stretchable thermoelectric porous graphene foam-based materials via facile laser scribing for self-powered decoupled strain and temperature sensing. The resulting sensor can accurately detect temperature with a resolution of 0.5°C and strain with a gauge factor of 1401.5. The design of the nanocomposites also explores the synergistic effect between the porous graphene and thermoelectric components to greatly enhance the Seebeck coefficient by almost four times (from 9.703 to 37.33 μV/°C). Combined with the stretchability of 45\%, the self-powered sensor platform allows for early fire detection in remote settings and accurate and decoupled monitoring of temperature and strain during the wound healing process in situ. The design concepts from this study could also be leveraged to prepare multimodal sensors with decoupled sensing capability for accurate multi-parameter detection towards health monitoring.},

	abstract = {We theoretically propose a Hall effect driven by effective gravitational fields arising from quantum geometry. We develop four mechanisms for this ''emergent-gravity Hall effect" : real-space gravity, momentum-space gravity, gravitional anomalous velocity, and gravitational Lorentz force which are described by the Christoffel symbols in real, momentum, and time spaces. We construct a unified theoretical framework to systematically investigate the effects of emergent gravity in these spaces on transport phenomena based on the semiclassical theory. We demonstrate these effects by model calculations and clarify the conditions under which a finite Hall response can arise. Our findings open a new avenue for exploring gravitational effects in quantum systems.},

	abstract = {The quantum fluctuation-induced Casimir force can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the dielectric permittivities and magnetic permeabilities of the materials involved. However, it is challenging to manipulate the dielectric permittivities of most materials using external fields. In contrast, the magnetic permeabilities of ferrofluids can be readily tuned by magnetic fields, which opens up the possibility of magnetic-field tuning of the Casimir force. Here, we demonstrate that this tuning can be achieved for a gold sphere and a silica plate immersed in water-based ferrofluids. Our theoretical calculations predict that, by varying the magnetic field, separation distance and ferrofluid volume fraction, the Casimir force can be tuned from attractive to repulsive over a wide range of parameters in this system. Experimentally, we develop a cantilever designed to conduct measurements within water-based ferrofluids. Using this setup, we observe the predicted transitions. These findings may lead to the development of switchable micromechanical devices based on the Casimir effect.},

	abstract = {The galaxy correlation function serves as a fundamental tool for studying cosmology, galaxy formation and the nature of dark matter. It is well established that more massive, redder and more compact galaxies tend to have stronger clustering in space1,2. These results can be understood in terms of galaxy formation in cold dark matter (CDM) halos of different mass and assembly history. Here we report an unexpectedly strong large-scale clustering for isolated, diffuse and blue dwarf galaxies, comparable to that seen for massive galaxy groups but much stronger than that expected from their halo mass. Our analysis indicates that the strong clustering aligns with the halo assembly bias seen in simulations3 with the standard ΛCDM cosmology only if more diffuse dwarfs formed in low-mass halos of older ages. This pattern is not reproduced by existing models of galaxy evolution in a ΛCDM framework4-6, and our finding provides clues for the search of more viable models. Our results can be explained well by assuming self-interacting dark matter7, suggesting that such a scenario should be considered seriously.},

	abstract = {The global commissioning of multi-Petawatt laser systems provides unprecedented access to ultra-high electromagnetic fields for probing the quantum vacuum. However, current analytical models are limited, necessitating large-scale simulations for experimental validation. Here, we present real-time three-dimensional simulations of two quantum vacuum effects, using a semi-classical numerical solver based on the Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian. The simulation model is benchmarked against vacuum birefringence analytical results with a counter-propagating setup. Simulations results of both plane-wave and Gaussian pulses are consistent with theoretical predictions. The solver is then applied to four-wave mixing using three Gaussian pulses with real-time information on the harmonic evolution. We provide quantitative explanations for the astigmatism in the output and produce precise estimates of the interaction time and size. Results are compared with the plane-wave model and previous numerical results. This solver paves the way for in-depth investigations of a broad spectrum of quantum vacuum effects in any arbitrary laser setup.},
